# signalk-weather-map

A [SignalK](https://signalk.org) webapp that displays meteorological forecast data on an interactive map — wind barbs, temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, pressure and gusts, powered by any SignalK weather provider.

## Features

- **Wind barbs** — standard meteorological notation (½ bar = 5 kt, bar = 10 kt, pennant = 50 kt)
- **Gusts** — same barb display based on gust speed
- **Temperature** — colour-coded cells with numeric label (blue → green → yellow → red)
- **Cloudiness** — transparency-based grey overlay (0 % = transparent, 100 % = dark grey)
- **Precipitation** — colour-coded intensity (transparent → light blue → blue → purple → red)
- **Pressure** — colour-coded cells with numeric hPa label (dark blue = storm/low < 960 → cyan → green ≈ 1013 → orange → dark red = anticyclone > 1022)
- **Bounded rendering** — adaptive grid density, capped Leaflet markers, and a bounded-resolution canvas keep pan and zoom responsive
- **Forecast timeline** — browse or play through every forecast step returned by the weather source, stopping at the provider's last available step
- **Multi-provider support** — select any registered SignalK weather provider; set a default with one click
- **Collapsible panel** — panel and legend collapse to a one-line summary (model + layer) for mobile use; state persisted across sessions
- **Vessel position** — boat marker oriented to true heading (falls back to north if unavailable)
- **Client-side cache** — 30-minute localStorage + memory cache; bounded batch fetching (6 concurrent)
- **Signal K units** — reads the per-user Unit Preferences preset, then the active server preset, for wind, temperature, pressure, and precipitation displays
- **i18n** — UI language detected from the browser (French and English supported)

## Requirements

- SignalK server with at least one weather provider plugin installed and enabled  
  (e.g. [signalk-grib-weather-provider](https://github.com/macjl/signalk-grib-weather-provider), Open-Meteo, etc.)
- Node.js ≥ 12

## Installation

### From npm (recommended)

In the SignalK server's app store, search for **signalk-weather-map** and install it.

Or from the command line inside the SignalK data directory:

```sh
npm install signalk-weather-map
```

Then restart the SignalK server.

### Manual / development

```sh
cd ~/.signalk/   # or your SignalK data directory
mkdir -p local-plugins
git clone https://github.com/macjl/signalk-weather-map local-plugins/signalk-weather-map
# Add to package.json dependencies:
#   "signalk-weather-map": "file:./local-plugins/signalk-weather-map"
npm install
```

## Usage

Once installed, the webapp is available at:

```
http://<signalk-host>:<port>/signalk-weather-map/
```

Or open it from the SignalK dashboard → **Webapps**.

### Layer selector

| Layer | Description |
|---|---|
| Wind | Barbs based on true wind speed |
| Gusts | Barbs based on gust speed |
| Temperature | Colour-coded cell fill with °C label |
| Cloudiness | Grey transparency proportional to cloud cover |
| Precipitation | Colour intensity proportional to rain volume |
| Pressure | Colour-coded cell fill with hPa label (blue = low, red = high) |

### Tooltip

Hover over any cell to see full data: wind speed & direction, gusts, temperature, MSLP, humidity, cloud cover and precipitation.

### Provider selector

If multiple weather providers are registered, select one from the **Source** dropdown. Click **Set as default** to make it the server-wide default.

## Weather API

This plugin uses the standard SignalK v2 Weather API:

```
GET /signalk/v2/api/weather/forecasts/point?lat=&lon=&provider=<pluginId>
GET /signalk/v2/api/weather/_providers
POST /signalk/v2/api/weather/_providers/_default/:id
```

Any provider that implements this API is compatible.

### GRIB and performance

This webapp deliberately does not download or parse GRIB files in the browser. A GRIB-backed
weather provider should download, decode, and cache its model data on the Signal K server, then
answer the Weather API from that prepared cache. The map retains a short client cache for redraws
and panning, but server-side GRIB handling is the path to responsive multi-device and offline use.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/macjl/signalk-weather-map
cd signalk-weather-map
# Edit public/index.html — no build step required (vanilla JS + Leaflet CDN)
```
